## Support Platform
* Android
* Linux (x86, x86_64, amd64)
* Windows (x86, x86_64)
* OSX (x86, x86_64)

## How to build

The project is using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) to build and package the native binaries into a jar file (See Gradle [Building native binaries](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/nativeBinaries.html) for more info). The packaged jar file will be located in build/libs folder.

```
$ cd <sqlite-system|sqlite|sqlcipher>
$ gradlew -Pspec=<android|java> clean
$ gradlew -Pspec=<android|java> build
```
### Android
* [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html)

 Make sure that you have the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` variable defined. For example,
 ```
 #.bashrc:
 export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/android-ndk-r11c
```

### Linux 
* To build the x86 binary on a 64-bit machine, you will need to setup a 64-bit toolchain as follows.

```
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
$ sudo apt-get install g++-multilib
```

### Windows
* Visual Studio 2015 is required. 

### OSX
* Command Line Tools for Xcode is required. You may download the Command Line Tools from the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads) website.
